# MachineLearning

This project studies on the problem of the high dropout rate on MOOC learning platforms. To predict whether a user will drop a course, we conducted the preliminary experiments on the provided training and testing data set in order to find the suitable classifiers to use.

In phase one of project, we show the exploratory analysis of the classification accuracy of many classifiers. The accuracy of our prediction results in this phase was poor. In phase two of project, we select three models with good performance from the candidate models in phase one. Then we optimize the parameters roughly based on all features of provided training data and testing data, the accuracy and AUC are not optimal for the effect of meaningless features. Hence, we do the feature selection to reduce the meaningless features and then do the parameter optimization.
